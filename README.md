# Software-Testing
Ensuring Quality, One Test at a Time

Fundamentals of testing
1. Purpose of testing completio is to determine when to stop testing.
2. Features to be tested, the testing tasks and test deliverables should be specified in which documents: Test plan
3. The field testing will be performed by the people at the client location also known as Beta testing.
4. Key principles of software: The purpose of software testing is demonstrating the absence of defects in software products
5. Evaluating testabilit of the requirement and system are part of Test Analysis and Design phase
6. Key reason why developer have difficulty in testing: Lack of Objectivity
7. When to stop testing: Technical risk, Business risk and project constraint
8. Incidents are part of test implementation and execution phase
9. Designing the test environment set-up: Test Analysis and design
10. Sequential steps in Fundamental process:
  - Testing planning and control
  - Analysis and Design
  - Implementation and execution
  - Evaluating exit criteria and reporting
  - Test closure activity
11. Purpose of exit criteria: To determine when a test has completed
12. A deviation from the specified or expected behavior that is visible to end-user called as defect
13. Error(mistake) is a human action that produces an incorrect result
14. Fault(defect, bug) is a flaw in a component or system that can cause the component or system to fail to perform it's required function.
15. Exhaustive testing is impractical and impossible
16. Main activity of fundamental test process - Planning and control
17. Objective for software testing - Uncover software error
18. Purpose of exit criteria - Define when to stop testing, end of test level and when a set of tests has achieved a specified precondition.
19. The process analysing and removing causes of failure in software

Some Q&A we come across as a frehser

# 2. If someone pretends to helps you but later put you in dark light in front of upper management then how to deal effectively?
When someone acts supportive but later discredits you in front of leadership, it can be frustrating and damaging. Hereâ€™s how to handle the situation professionally and strategically:

1. Stay Calm and Observe
ðŸ”¹ Don't react emotionallyâ€”avoid confrontation in the heat of the moment.
ðŸ”¹ Gather evidenceâ€”note instances where they misrepresented your work or took undue credit.
ðŸ”¹ Understand their intentâ€”is this a pattern or a one-time situation?

2. Strengthen Your Visibility & Communication
ðŸ”¹ Document your contributionsâ€”maintain clear records of your work (emails, reports, meeting notes).
ðŸ”¹ Keep leadership informed proactivelyâ€”donâ€™t let others be the only voice reporting on your work.
ðŸ”¹ Send status updatesâ€”after meetings or key discussions, summarize your contributions via email.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
"Following up on todayâ€™s discussion, I worked on [task] and collaborated with [colleague] to ensure smooth execution. Let me know if any further inputs are needed."

3. Address the Issue Tactfully
ðŸ”¹ Speak to the person privately and professionallyâ€”avoid a confrontational tone.
ðŸ”¹ Example:
"I noticed some misalignment in how our work was represented in the last meeting. Iâ€™d like us to ensure clarity going forward so thereâ€™s no confusion for management."

ðŸ”¹ If they deny it, reinforce your position through clear communication and documentation.

4. Build Alliances & Gain Support
ðŸ”¹ Collaborate with other colleaguesâ€”if others recognize your contributions, itâ€™s harder for one person to discredit you.
ðŸ”¹ Seek mentors or allies in leadership who can vouch for your work.
ðŸ”¹ Stay actively involved in key meetings so you control your narrative.

5. Escalate If Necessary (But Professionally)
ðŸ”¹ If the issue persists, bring it up diplomatically with your manager.
ðŸ”¹ Focus on facts, not emotionsâ€”frame it as a concern for team transparency rather than personal conflict.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
"Iâ€™ve noticed some discrepancies in how my work is being presented. I want to ensure we maintain clear communication so the team's efforts are recognized accurately."

ðŸ”¹ If necessary, involve HRâ€”but as a last resort after trying direct resolution.

6. Maintain Professionalism & Keep Excelling
ðŸ”¹ Donâ€™t engage in office politicsâ€”stay professional and let your results speak for themselves.
ðŸ”¹ Keep a strong reputationâ€”integrity and performance will outshine negativity over time.
ðŸ”¹ Stay resilientâ€”these situations happen in corporate settings, but handling them gracefully can boost your credibility.

Bottom Line:
ðŸ“Œ Control your narrative, document your work, and communicate strategically. If needed, address the issue diplomatically and escalate professionally. Your work should speak louder than their words. ðŸš€

# 3. As a fresher when you have to work every saturday like weekday how to deal?
As a fresher, being expected to work Saturdays like a regular weekday can be challenging and exhausting, but handling it strategically and professionally can make it more manageable. Hereâ€™s how:

# 4. If Developer always ask for huge user story testing as quick sanity how to approach them?
When a developer frequently asks for a quick sanity test on a huge user story, it can be challenging because sanity testing is meant to be minimal and not a full-fledged validation. Hereâ€™s how to handle it effectively:

1. Set Clear Expectations on What Sanity Testing Covers
ðŸ”¹ Explain that sanity testing is meant to check core functionality and not a complete validation.
ðŸ”¹ Define scope limitationsâ€”let the developer know what will be tested and what wonâ€™t in a quick sanity check.

ðŸ“Œ Example Response:
"I can do a quick sanity check to verify the critical flows, but for a complete validation, weâ€™ll need additional time to ensure full coverage."

2. Prioritize & Identify Critical Areas
ðŸ”¹ Ask the developer which functionalities are most criticalâ€”this helps focus on high-risk areas first.
ðŸ”¹ Run basic functionality tests before deeper validation.

ðŸ“Œ Ask the Developer:
"Which key features or high-impact areas should I focus on first in the sanity check?"

3. Propose a Phased Testing Approach
ðŸ”¹ Suggest a phased approachâ€”start with sanity, followed by a detailed functional test later.
ðŸ”¹ If thereâ€™s pressure to test quickly, request a compromise (e.g., quick sanity first, in-depth testing after).

ðŸ“Œ Example Discussion:
"I can perform an initial sanity test in 30 minutes, but a full validation will require additional time. Letâ€™s plan accordingly to avoid missing any potential defects."

4. Automate Where Possible
ðŸ”¹ If similar requests keep repeating, automate sanity checks for faster execution.
ðŸ”¹ Use automated scripts for basic validation, freeing up time for detailed exploratory testing.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
"I can run an automated sanity test for key functionalitiesâ€”this will save time and ensure consistent checks."

5. Escalate if Unrealistic Timelines Persist
ðŸ”¹ If developers consistently demand large stories to be tested instantly, raise concerns diplomatically with the manager.
ðŸ”¹ Highlight the risk of missing defects due to rushed testing.

ðŸ“Œ Example Escalation:
"To maintain quality, we may need to allocate more time for testing large user stories. Rushing through sanity may lead to critical issues being overlooked."

Bottom Line:
âœ… Clarify what sanity testing includes and set realistic expectations.
âœ… Prioritize high-impact areas for sanity when time is limited.
âœ… Propose phased testingâ€”quick sanity first, full testing later.
âœ… Leverage automation to speed up repetitive sanity tests.
âœ… Escalate professionally if unrealistic deadlines persist.

# 5. How to approach UAT bug?
When a bug is found in UAT, itâ€™s critical to handle it efficiently and professionally to ensure a smooth resolution without delaying the release. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. Reproduce the Bug & Gather Evidence
ðŸ”¹ Confirm the issue â€“ Try to replicate the bug using the same steps.
ðŸ”¹ Check consistency â€“ Is it happening every time or only in specific cases?
ðŸ”¹ Collect logs/screenshots â€“ Attach screenshots, error messages, logs, and steps to reproduce.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
"Steps to reproduce:

Log in with valid credentials.
Click on â€˜Submit Orderâ€™.
System throws an error: â€˜Invalid Transaction IDâ€™."
2. Categorize the Bug Based on Severity & Impact
ðŸ”¹ Critical (P1) â€“ Blocking UAT/testing progress (e.g., system crash, data loss).
ðŸ”¹ High (P2) â€“ Major issue but with workarounds.
ðŸ”¹ Medium (P3) â€“ Functional bug that does not impact major workflows.
ðŸ”¹ Low (P4) â€“ UI/UX issue with no major impact.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
"This is a P1 critical bug as it blocks users from completing transactions."

3. Log the Bug in a Defect Tracking Tool
ðŸ”¹ Use JIRA, Azure DevOps, or Bugzilla to log the defect.
ðŸ”¹ Ensure it includes:

Title (Brief summary of the issue)
Description (Detailed steps & expected vs actual results)
Severity/Priority
Environment (Browser, OS, version, API details if applicable)
Attachments (Screenshots, logs, network traces)
ðŸ“Œ Example Ticket Title:
"Checkout button is unresponsive after entering payment details (P1)"

4. Communicate with the Right Stakeholders
ðŸ”¹ Inform developers for a quick fix.
ðŸ”¹ Notify business users/stakeholders if it affects UAT timelines.
ðŸ”¹ Suggest a workaround if possible to continue testing.

ðŸ“Œ Example Email/Message:
"We identified a P1 UAT bug where users cannot complete transactions due to an invalid ID error. The issue is logged in JIRA as BUG-1234, and steps to reproduce are included. Let me know if you need more details or logs for debugging."

5. Verify the Fix & Perform Regression Testing
ðŸ”¹ Once fixed, retest the issue to confirm resolution.
ðŸ”¹ Perform regression testing to check that the fix did not introduce new issues.
ðŸ”¹ Update the UAT team and close the defect if resolved.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
"The bug has been fixed in build v2.3.1 and verified successfully. Closing the ticket."

6. Prevent Similar Bugs in the Future
ðŸ”¹ Conduct a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to identify why the bug occurred.
ðŸ”¹ Update test cases to cover similar scenarios in the future.
ðŸ”¹ Suggest process improvements if needed (e.g., including more test coverage in SIT).

ðŸ“Œ Example RCA Action:
"Adding validation checks in API responses to prevent incorrect transaction IDs in future builds."

Bottom Line:
âœ… Reproduce & document the bug with evidence.
âœ… Categorize based on severity & log it properly in a defect tracking tool.
âœ… Communicate with developers & stakeholders for prioritization.
âœ… Verify the fix & prevent future occurrences through RCA.

# 6. When team ask to keep some bugs as low priortize and then when client caught it then it is taken as production bug
# How tester should react to this?
When a bug that was originally deprioritized by the team gets caught by the client in production, it can reflect poorly on the QA team and the overall product quality. Hereâ€™s how a tester should handle this situation professionally and proactively:

1. Stay Calm & Avoid the Blame Game
ðŸ”¹ Do not say "I told you so"â€”even if you raised the concern earlier.
ðŸ”¹ Focus on solving the problem rather than pointing fingers.
ðŸ”¹ Maintain a professional and constructive approach.

ðŸ“Œ Example Response:
"Letâ€™s analyze what went wrong and how we can prevent similar issues in the future."

2. Gather Evidence & Show Documentation
ðŸ”¹ Pull out your original bug report to show when and why the issue was logged.
ðŸ”¹ If you had recommended a higher priority, check if there were any discussions rejecting it.
ðŸ”¹ Use JIRA history or emails to highlight past decisions without blaming anyone.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
"This issue was originally reported as Bug-1234 and was categorized as low priority. Based on the impact seen now, we may need to revisit how we prioritize similar issues."

3. Conduct a Quick Impact Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Assess how severe the impact is in production.
ðŸ”¹ Identify affected users, financial impact, and business risks.
ðŸ”¹ If possible, provide temporary workarounds to minimize damage.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
"The bug is affecting X% of users during [specific function]. A temporary workaround is available while we work on a fix."

4. Escalate and Suggest an Immediate Fix
ðŸ”¹ Discuss with the team and prioritize the bug fix.
ðŸ”¹ Ensure a regression check so the fix doesnâ€™t introduce new issues.
ðŸ”¹ Keep stakeholders informed with updates on resolution progress.

ðŸ“Œ Example Email Update:
"The issue reported by the client aligns with Bug-1234. We are now prioritizing the fix and expect resolution in [X] hours. Regression testing is also planned to ensure stability."

5. Improve Future Bug Prioritization Process
ðŸ”¹ Recommend revising priority criteria for future bugs.
ðŸ”¹ Implement impact-based risk assessments during triage.
ðŸ”¹ Encourage UAT or business stakeholders to review certain "low-priority" bugs before dismissing them.

ðŸ“Œ Example Suggestion to Team:
"To avoid similar issues in the future, we should refine our prioritization process by considering real-world usage impact more closely."

6. Conduct a Post-Mortem / Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
ðŸ”¹ Identify why the bug was misprioritizedâ€”Was it lack of understanding? Lack of test coverage?
ðŸ”¹ Suggest adding test cases, better impact analysis, or stricter UAT validation.
ðŸ”¹ Document lessons learned for process improvement.

ðŸ“Œ Example RCA Action Item:
"Going forward, we will flag potential customer-facing bugs for additional review before deprioritization."

Bottom Line:
âœ… Stay professionalâ€”focus on solutions, not blame.
âœ… Show documentation to reinforce that the bug was logged earlier.
âœ… Assess impact quickly and help resolve the issue ASAP.
âœ… Advocate for better prioritization processes in the future.
âœ… Conduct an RCA to prevent similar issues from being overlooked again.
