# Misellaneous questions

# 1. What are un-reproducible bugs?
Un-reproducible bugs are issues that don’t consistently show up and can be tricky to fix. Examples include:

 • Bugs caused by low memory issues.
 • Errors from memory locations that don’t exist.
 • Bugs caused by race conditions (when the timing of one event affects another).
 
# 2. What is a critical bug?
A critical bug impacts a key feature of the application. It may:

 • Break core functionality.
 • Have no workaround.
 • Prevent the release of the application to users unless fixed.
 
# 3.  How do you know when to stop testing?
It’s tough to decide when to stop testing, but some common factors are:

 • Deadlines (for testing or release).
 • Completing most test cases with a high pass rate.
 • Running out of budget.
 • Achieving a certain level of code or functionality coverage.
 • A drop in the number of bugs reported.
 • Completion of alpha or beta testing phases.
 
# 4. What are the steps in a defect cycle?
Here’s how a defect moves through the process:

 1. Discovery: A bug is found during testing or by the user.
 2. Reporting: Testers document the bug with details and steps to reproduce.
 3. Prioritization: The bug is categorized by severity and impact.
 4. Assignment: It’s assigned to a developer.
 5. Fixing: The developer works on the fix.
 6. Validation: The tester confirms the fix works.
 7. Closure: The bug is marked as resolved.
