# Software-Testing
Ensuring Quality, One Test at a Time

Fundamentals of testing
1. Purpose of testing completio is to determine when to stop testing.
2. Features to be tested, the testing tasks and test deliverables should be specified in which documents: Test plan
3. The field testing will be performed by the people at the client location also known as Beta testing.
4. Key principles of software: The purpose of software testing is demonstrating the absence of defects in software products
5. Evaluating testabilit of the requirement and system are part of Test Analysis and Design phase
6. Key reason why developer have difficulty in testing: Lack of Objectivity
7. When to stop testing: Technical risk, Business risk and project constraint
8. Incidents are part of test implementation and execution phase
9. Designing the test environment set-up: Test Analysis and design
10. Sequential steps in Fundamental process:
  - Testing planning and control
  - Analysis and Design
  - Implementation and execution
  - Evaluating exit criteria and reporting
  - Test closure activity
11. Purpose of exit criteria: To determine when a test has completed
12. A deviation from the specified or expected behavior that is visible to end-user called as defect
13. Error(mistake) is a human action that produces an incorrect result
14. Fault(defect, bug) is a flaw in a component or system that can cause the component or system to fail to perform it's required function.
15. Exhaustive testing is impractical and impossible
16. Main activity of fundamental test process - Planning and control
17. Objective for software testing - Uncover software error
18. Purpose of exit criteria - Define when to stop testing, end of test level and when a set of tests has achieved a specified precondition.
19. The process analysing and removing causes of failure in software
